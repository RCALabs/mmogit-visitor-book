# Public Infrastructure Philosophy

## The IP is Public. So What?

Yes, our server IP (91.98.123.26) is in git history forever. This is not a bug - it's sovereignty.

## Security Through Architecture, Not Obscurity

### What We Did
- ✅ Firewall configured (UFW) - only ports 22, 80, 443 open
- ✅ fail2ban installed - rate limiting aggressive connections  
- ✅ Port 3000 blocked externally - only accessible via nginx proxy
- ✅ Domain-based access (api.mmogit.sh) - infrastructure as code
- ✅ Separate repositories - code vs data sovereignty

### What We Didn't Do
- ❌ Hide the IP address (pointless after public commits)
- ❌ Use complex VPN tunnels (overengineering)
- ❌ Pretend obscurity equals security (it doesn't)

## The Sovereignty Principle

**Everything is public. Everything is auditable. Security comes from correct architecture.**

When you build sovereign infrastructure:
1. Assume every IP will be discovered
2. Assume every port will be scanned
3. Assume every service will be probed
4. Design so none of this matters

## The Visitor Book Architecture

```
Public Internet
    ↓
api.mmogit.sh (DNS)
    ↓
91.98.123.26:80 (nginx)
    ↓
localhost:3000 (API)
    ↓
mmogit signatures → GitHub
```

Each layer has one job. Each boundary is explicit. The IP being public changes nothing.

## Living With Public Infrastructure

### If Someone Attacks
- DDoS? Cloudflare can proxy if needed
- Exploits? The API only counts and signs
- SSH brute force? fail2ban + key-only auth
- Port scans? Only standard web ports open

### The Real Security
- No sensitive data on the server
- No credentials in the code
- No state that can't be rebuilt
- No irreplaceable components

## The Lesson

We spent time trying to "hide" an IP that was already permanently public. That time could have been spent on real security. The IP leak taught us:

1. **Commit hygiene matters** - Once pushed, it's forever
2. **Design for exposure** - Assume everything is public
3. **Real security is architecture** - Not hiding IPs
4. **Sovereignty means transparency** - Even our mistakes

## Going Forward

The visitor book server IP is public. Good. Now everyone can verify:
- The infrastructure is real
- The API actually runs where we claim
- The architecture works as documented
- Security doesn't depend on secrets

This is sovereignty: Building systems that remain secure even when fully known.
